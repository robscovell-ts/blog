# Guilt

I've been increasingly conscious recently that our secular culture
really doesn't know how to deal with guilt.

When people are consistently told that they are OK as they are
(I'm OK, You're OK), what happens when your conscience tells
you that you're not OK?

- You're not a bad person: you just made some bad choices
- I only did it because (x y z)
- It's only because society is messed up that I feel guilt.

What then happens if you have a whole generation brought up to
believe that they are special and that their choices must be
honoured, however destructive or stupid they are?

When guilt bubbles to the surface and doesn't fit ones' view
of oneself, or one's worldview, then the inevitable next step
is to find someone or something to blame. The scapegoat.

- My parents
- Society
- "Old people"
- "White Men" / the "Patriarchy"
- Immigrants
- Jews
- Capitalists.

The same scapegoating happens when a person's achievements do
not reflect their self-image. It can't possibly be something to
do with them, so someone/something must be at fault.

Scapegoating is _incredibly_ dangerous, especially if it
is a mass phenomenon, as we are seeing in the riots in various
large cities across the USA at the moment. Many of the rioters
and/or protesters are somewhat privileged young people rather than
genuine black people with genuine grievances.

The scapegoats of the day are:
