# Guilt

I've been increasingly conscious recently that our secular culture
really doesn't know how to deal with guilt.

When people are consistently told that they are OK as they are
(I'm OK, You're OK), what happens when your conscience tells
you that you're not OK?

- You're not a bad person: you just made some bad choices
- I only did it because (x y z)
