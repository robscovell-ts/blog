# Guilt

I've been increasingly conscious recently that our secular culture
really doesn't know how to deal with guilt.

When people are consistently told that they are OK as they are
(I'm OK, You're OK), what happens when your conscience tells
you that you're not OK?

- You're not a bad person: you just made some bad choices
- I only did it because (x y z)
- It's only because society is messed up that I feel guilt.

What then happens if you have a whole generation brought up to
believe that they are special and that their choices must be
honoured, however destructive or stupid they are?

When guilt bubbles to the surface and doesn't fit ones' view
of oneself, or one's worldview, then the inevitable next step
is to find someone or something to blame. The scapegoat.

- My parents
- Society
- "Old people"
- "White Men" / the "Patriarchy"
- Immigrants
- Jews
- Capitalists.

The same scapegoating happens when a person's achievements do
not reflect their self-image. It can't possibly be something to
do with them, so someone/something must be at fault.

Scapegoating is _incredibly_ dangerous, especially if it
is a mass phenomenon, as we are seeing in the riots in various
large cities across the USA at the moment. Many of the rioters
and/or protesters are somewhat privileged young people rather than
genuine black people with genuine grievances.

There is nothing new about scapegoating: it is a persistent factor in human
nature. However, most cultures in most ages have sought to manage personal
guilt through the use of _sacrifice_. In the days of King Solomon,
God commanded a temple to be build for the people of Israel to make sacrifices
for their sins. In one form of the sacrifice, two goats were used. One would
be killed and consumed and the other would be allowed to escape. Hence the
word "Scapegoat". The escaping goat symbolised the sins of the penitent
being released.

The crucifixion of Christ on the Cross marked the end of the Temple sacrificial
system. God offered up his own son to be the sacrificial victim, and the
ultimate scapegoat. By allowing us to have moral freedom, there is a sense
in which God is to blame for all the sin and guilt in the world.

This is why I believe that it is wrong to de-emphasise the sacrificial nature
of the Eucharist, making it into a mere meal of fellowship. Over the last
50 years, the sacrificial aspects of the Eucharist have been diluted to
homoeopathic levels. I suspect this is because it has been thought that
notions of sacrifice are 'out-dated'.

A sacrificial Eucharist, preceded by Confession, gives the faithful access to
a mechanism for processing their guilt and bringing it to the Cross.

I believe that authorities in the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches need
to reverse their theological directions and revert to traditional,
sacrificial celebrations of the Eucharist.

As a bit of a tangent, while I have been pondering these ideas, I have become aware
that about 80% of discourse in 'news' and 'social' media is about blame. I have
realised that Christians (including me) need to desist from this. Feelings of blame
need to be confessed and laid at the altar.
